                    <p class="blackbox">
                        I have developed a robust and diverse career, marked by a series of 
                        roles that have each contributed to my extensive skill set. 
                        Currently, I am a Team Lead and Quality Analyst at TELUS International, 
                        where I excel in time management, problem-solving, attention to detail, 
                        and conflict resolution. In this role, I maintain high-quality production 
                        standards, manage stakeholder communication, conduct team meetings, 
                        provide coaching, and offer guidance to my team.
                    </p>

                    <h4>April 1st - August 1st, 2023</h4>
                    <p class="blackbox">
                        Before relocating to Latvia, I worked as an IT Project Manager at Neetry 
                        LLC in Armenia from April 1st to August 1st, 2023. During my tenure, I 
                        enhanced my expertise in Agile methodologies, specifically Kanban, and 
                        collaborated closely with developers and UX/UI teams using the Jira 
                        management tool. My responsibilities included project planning and execution, 
                        stakeholder communication and management, monitoring and conducting project 
                        status meetings, task creation and assignment, and fostering a collaborative 
                        work environment.
                    </p>

                    <h4>April 4th, 2022 - January 16th, 2023</h4>
                    <p class="blackbox">
                        My career in IT began at WeSage, where I served as an IT Project Manager 
                        from April 4th, 2022, to January 16th, 2023. At WeSage, I was responsible 
                        for project planning and execution, stakeholder communication and management, 
                        monitoring project progress, conducting status meetings, task creation and 
                        assignment, and cultivating a collaborative work environment.Unfortunately, in 
                        Januray this company got closed, so I had to find another job.
                    </p>

                    <h4>February 1st, 2021 - March 31st, 2022</h4>
                    <p class="blackbox">
                        Prior to my IT roles, I gained valuable experience as an Online Casino Dealer
                        at Soft Construct. This role provided me with a deep understanding of the 
                        backend operations of casinos, the frontend user experience, and the overall 
                        workflow within the industry.
